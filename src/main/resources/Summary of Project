(*) - normal challenge to overcome
(**) - hard challenge to overcome
(***) - very hard challenge to overcome


Challenges
1. infinite loop between class CheckWinConditions and TicTacToe, program crash (***)
2. how to divide code into separate classes to better code comprehension (*)
3. NewGameLoop class dont work (correctly) initial solution timer.schedule(new TimerTask() method,
implement JButton or key Scanner to restart game (**)
4. restart game using Scanner prove difficult, switch to JButtons (advantage can restart game at any time) (**)
5. how to implement WIN/LOSE/TIE? (*)
5.1 why WIN/LOSE/TIE dont update (*)
6. how dose AI work? what algorytm to use? (**)
6.1 how to implement Minimax? (**)
6.2 found solution but the code is not compatible with project (need to find a way to modify it) (***)
6.3 CPU dont behave as intended, think "X" symbol belong to him, also cant chose optimal wining strategy (**)
7. how to implement 6x6 grid (3 in line to win) (*)
7.1 problem method calculating win dont work/ why? (*)
7.1.2 method out of bound exception, need to fix variable (***)
7.2 class NewGameLoop dont work (**)
8. java SWING have multiple layout function / how to combine those layout? (**)
9. You can click before CPU move (*)
10. when choosing grid multiple times the grid multiply how to fix since "jpanel.remove()" dont work (***)
11. MiniMax algorithm impossible to implement on a 6x6 grid
12. when running 6x6 cant click on "New Game" till minmax algorithm finish working (**)
13. how to refactor a program that has 1000 line of code? what code can be erase or replace (**)



Improvements
1. Divide initial code into separate classes (BoardCreator, TicTacToe, CheckWinConditions) - (done) - v 1.1
2. restart game (done) - v 2.0
3. create WIN/LOSE/TIE counter (done) - v 2.1
4. CPU AI for grid 3x3 (done) - v 3.0 /  CPU AI for grid 6x6 (partially AI isnt very good) - v 3.1
5. different game grid (3x3 and 6x6) (done) - v 3.0
5.1 allow player chose grid (done) - v 3.1
5.2 program need to know what MiniMaxAlgorithm and CheckWinConditions class to chose (done) - v 3.1
5.3 NewGameLoop for grid 3x3 and 6x6 (done) - v 3.1
5.4 dont allow the player to click a second time before CPU make his move (done) - v 3.1
6. how to change code so it is more compatible with "encapsulation" principle (done) - v 3.2
7. use layout to have the application look better (done) - v 3.1
8. update the GUI structure (introduce new functions for more interesting UI) / (done) - v 3.1
9. if NewGameLoop make so the PlayX is the first to move (done) - v 3.1
